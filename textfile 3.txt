IMPROVED CODEX PROMPT (DO NOT OMIT ANYTHING BELOW)

[RUN CONFIG]
Model: GPT-5.3-Codex (Codex 5.3)
Reasoning: HIGH
Temperature: 0.0
Max tokens: Large (allow full site generation)
Output format: Single ZIP-style project listing + file contents
App environment: Codex App on macOS — produce a ready-to-import Wix Velo project layout.
Notes for runner: produce machine-parseable file headers exactly like:
=== FILE: path/to/file ===
<file contents>
Keep each file self-contained. Clearly annotate any places where keys or external services are required.

[OVERVIEW — Mission]
Build a page-focused, production-quality Wix Velo website for SafariMatcher.com — a consumer travel discovery & review site for safari tours and wildlife lodges. The site must look/feel like a real travel brand (TripAdvisor / premium travel magazine): editorial + photo-forward, NOT an admin dashboard and NOT an AI tooling UI.

TOP-LEVEL NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS (MUST FOLLOW)
1) Do NOT implement any matching algorithm or matching frontend.
   - Only create page placeholders and a documented client-side placeholder function:
     public/utils/matchingPlaceholder.js
   - It returns a well-documented fixed-format placeholder response.
   - Do not implement algorithmic matching.
   - Do not show algorithmic results anywhere in the UI.
2) Do NOT create admin UIs or moderation dashboards.
   - Admin tasks are manually handled via Wix Collections (document in README).
3) Do NOT use the word "collins" anywhere in generated UI copy or filenames.
4) Remove all backend/server files:
   - Do not include backend/ or any .jsw files.
   - If server-side work is advisable, document where/how to add it in README and provide client-side safe fallbacks.
5) Include Feedback & FAQ public pages with collection-backed behavior.
6) Use Wix Velo idioms/APIs:
   - $w, wix-data, wix-users, wix-location, wix-fetch (where needed).
7) Implement subtle, high-quality UI animations and scroll effects (see mandatory spec).
8) Mobile-first responsive design; WCAG-friendly accessibility.
9) Animations must be subtle, performant, non-distracting, and include “reduce motion” fallback + an option to disable animations.

[TONE & DESIGN GOALS]
- Photo-first, editorial, warm, trustworthy, adventurous, premium but welcoming.
- Avoid database/table aesthetics; prefer hero photography, card-based listings, storytelling sections, and micro-interactions.
- Mobile-first responsive design and WCAG-friendly accessibility.
- Animations must be subtle, non-distracting, and performant; include an accessible “reduce motion” fallback.

[SCOPE — Deliver exactly the items below (NO backend)]
DELIVERABLES (MUST OUTPUT ALL OF THESE)
1) README.md
   - Setup and import steps
   - Where to paste each file in Wix Editor (Dev Mode / Velo)
   - Where API keys go (and how to run without them)
   - Which parts are placeholders vs production-ready
   - Guidance for adding server-side modules later (no server code included)
   - Security notes + input sanitization notes

6) Reviews:
   - Public submission saves to Reviews collection via client wix-data.insert()
   - status = "approved" by default (no moderation UI)
   - Client-side spam protections (honeypot + rate-limit note)
   - Document optional server-side rate limiting in README (do not include server code)

   - Caching suggestions
   - In-code best-practices comments

[ANIMATIONS & EFFECTS — SPECIFIC & MANDATORY]
Implement subtle, performant UI animations across the site with these exact behaviors.
Prefer Wix Velo native functions where possible; where CSS is required, use an embeddable HTML component or element-level transitions Wix supports.
Always include reduced-motion support and an option to disable animations.

1) Hero parallax
   - slight parallax on hero background image when user scrolls (max translate ~20px)
   - fallback: static hero if parallax not available
   - prefer onViewportEnter + lightweight transform via requestAnimationFrame OR CSS transform inside an HTML component for performance
2) Card hover (listing cards)
   - scale up to ~1.03
   - increase box-shadow depth
   - translateY up by 6–10px
   - subtle image brightness increase
   - implement via onMouseIn/onMouseOut or CSS in HTML component
   - ensure hover effects disabled on touch devices
3) Image hover micro-zoom
   - gallery + hero thumbnails: gentle zoom on hover (scale 1.05)
   - smooth transition 200–300ms
4) Scroll reveal
   - elements fade/slide in on entering viewport with stagger 50–120ms
   - use $w.onViewportEnter where appropriate OR IntersectionObserver polyfill in public/utils/animations.js if needed
5) Sticky subtle nav animation
   - after scrolling past hero: navbar becomes compact (reduced height, slight background blur/color shift)
   - use wix-window scroll events or wix-location to toggle classes
6) Micro-interactions
   - buttons press animation (scale ~0.98) + accessible focus states
   - links underline slide-in on hover
7) Performance constraints
   - use transform + opacity only for animations (GPU)
   - use will-change sparingly and remove when not needed
   - debounce scroll handlers + requestAnimationFrame for transforms
   - respect prefers-reduced-motion (disable non-essential animations)
8) Wix CSS restriction implementation note
   - implement animations using:
     - $w('#element').onMouseIn / onMouseOut to toggle CSS classes on HTML components, OR
     - HTML component snippets for custom CSS transforms, OR
     - Velo show('fade', duration) for simple reveals + onViewportEnter for triggers
   - include clear comments for each approach
   - provide a consistent animations.js utility that centralizes parameters + reduced-motion detection

[DETAILED REQUIREMENTS — technical (client-only)]
- Use wix-data.query() for search & filters; implement pagination (skip/limit).
- Include a debounced text search (300ms).
- Filters:
  - region
  - priceFrom (range)
  - durationDays (range)
  - ratingAvg (min)
  - amenities (multi-select chips)
  UI:
  - drawer or side panel on desktop
  - collapsible accordion on mobile
- Dynamic routes:
  - /tour/{slug}
  - /lodge/{slug}
  Implement via routers.js.
- Implement sitemap endpoint /sitemap.xml using router exports.
- Images:
  - use Wix Media Manager
  - implement image galleries with lazy loading (loading="lazy" where possible)
  - aspect-ratio containers
- Maps:
  - client-side sample integration with Mapbox
  - fallback to address text when key absent
- Reviews & Feedback:
  - wix-data.insert() writes to collections
  - client-side validation + honeypot + rate-limit note in README
  - no server code included
- Rating aggregation:
  - after inserting a review, recompute ratingAvg + reviewCount client-side by querying reviews and updating parent item via wix-data.update()
  - document that production should move this server-side due to race-condition risks (README)
- No backend modules or server files included.
  - Any server-side necessity must be documented in README with sample pseudocode and where to place server files later.

[COLLECTION SCHEMAS (examples — include in seed-data.json)]
- Tours:
  {_id, title, slug, shortDescription, longDescription, country, region, durationDays, priceFrom, amenities[], images[], operatorId, ratingAvg, reviewCount, featured, tags[]}
- Lodges:
  {_id, title, slug, location, shortDesc, longDesc, starRating, images[], capacity, amenities[], operatorId, ratingAvg, reviewCount, tags[]}
- Reviews:
  {_id, itemId (ref), itemType ("tour"|"lodge"), userId, rating (1-5), title, body, status ("approved"), createdAt}
- Feedback:
  {_id, name, email, type ("bug"|"suggestion"|"praise"|"other"), message, createdAt}
- FAQ:
  {_id, question, answer, tags[], order, updatedAt}
- Operators:
  {_id, name, logo, website, description, verified}
- Users:
  {_id, displayName, avatar, bio}
- BlogPosts:
  {_id, title, slug, excerpt, content, heroImage, authorId, publishDate, tags[]}

[MATCHING NOTE — explicit (REPEAT)]
Do not implement matching logic or a matching UI.
- Create client-side placeholder at public/utils/matchingPlaceholder.js
  - accepts {preferences, userId}
  - returns fixed-format placeholder object OR { status: 501, message: "Not Implemented" }
- Provide example front-end code that calls the placeholder and renders ONLY a friendly card:
  "Matching service not yet connected — see curated picks" linking to Discover
- Do not display any algorithmic matching results.

[DESIGN & UX]
- Photo-forward editorial layout: large hero photography, card-based listings, editorial blocks for itineraries and stories.
- Microcopy should read like a real travel brand; provide polished placeholder copy.
- Visual system:
  - neutral palette + single accent color
  - generous whitespace
  - rounded cards
  - soft shadows
  - subtle transitions
- Mobile-first responsive breakpoints; filters collapse into an accessible drawer on small screens.

[OUTPUT FORMAT & ORGANIZATION (STRICT)]
OUTPUT MUST BE ONLY:
1) A brief 3-line execution summary at the very top (no extra commentary).
2) Then the ZIP-style tree with every file and contents using:
   === FILE: path/to/file ===
   <file contents>
For each page:
- Include a short “Wix Editor elements checklist”:
  which elements to add + their IDs (must match the $w selectors in code).
- Include the Velo page code file (e.g., public/pages/HomePage.js) binding to those IDs.
Animations:
- include public/utils/animations.js
- use it from pages/components consistently.
Seed data:
- collections/seed-data.json must be valid JSON importable into Wix Collections (array of named collections).

At the top of README, include a quick checklist:
- Paste files into Wix Dev Mode
- Create Collections named X
- Import collections/seed-data.json
- Enable routers
- Upload assets
- Set API keys

[QUALITY & SAFETY]
- Use clear production-ready variable/function names.
- Add inline comments explaining WHY decisions were made.
- Sanitize user inputs; document security considerations in README.
- Accessibility:
  - ARIA labels
  - keyboard support for filters & accordion
  - contrast checks noted in design-specs.md
- Do not include copyrighted text verbatim beyond short UI copy.
  - Use short placeholder copy labeled as sample content.

[BEHAVIORAL/STYLE CONSTRAINTS]
- Do not output extra commentary beyond:
  - the 3-line execution summary at top
  - the ZIP-style file output
- Do not invent or call proprietary Wix APIs that do not exist.
  - use documented Velo APIs; annotate differences/uncertainties in README.
- Avoid the word "collins" anywhere (UI copy, filenames, comments, etc.).

[ENDING]
End with a final short summary (max 3 lines) listing:
1) Files generated
2) Next step for user (import seed-data, enable Dev Mode)
3) Location of matching placeholder and how to replace it.
